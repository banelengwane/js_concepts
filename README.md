# Javascript Concepts
These are the concepts covered in this roadmap:
- Destructuring: an assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
- Rest / Spread operator: Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.
- The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy
- An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage: Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this , arguments , or super , and should not be used as methods
