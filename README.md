# Javascript Concepts
These are the concepts covered in this roadmap:
- Destructuring: an assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
- Rest / Spread operator: Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element.
- The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark ( ? ), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : ), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy
- An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, with some semantic differences and deliberate limitations in usage: Arrow functions don't have their own bindings to this , arguments , or super , and should not be used as methods
- Short-circuit evaluation occurs when using logical operators like `&&` (AND) and `||` (OR). Let's take a closer look at each of these operators. The logical AND operator (`&&`) returns `true` if both of its operands are `true`, and it returns `false` if at least one of them is `false`.
Optional chaining lives up to its name. In the chain of object property access we can check that each value is not undefined or null. This check can be extremely useful when accessing deeply nested object values. It has been a highly anticipated feature and it keeps you from having to do numerous null checks.
